# jsactor-spa-example

Very rough and messy examples of using [jsactor](https://github.com/CodeMettle/jsactor). Many of the things here shouldn't be done, most of it was just code that came about during experimentation. Does demonstrate using jsactor to talk to backend.

Taken from https://github.com/vmunier/play-with-scalajs-example and https://github.com/ochrons/scalajs-spa-tutorial (and React tutorials). Definitely check those out first if you're interested in using Scala.js with Play, or interested in using Scala.js with React.

Fire it up by cloning it, changing to the directory, executing `sbt run`, and opening a web browser to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/).
